# Azure AI Search Agentic Retrieval Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use the Azure AI Foundry with Azure Cognitive Search to build an agentic retrieval application. The application uses a language model to interpret user queries, retrieve relevant documents from a search index, and generate responses based on the retrieved information.

This sample uses the NASA Earth at night data found [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/tree/main/nasa-e-book/earth-at-night-json).
